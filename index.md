### CPSC 120

- [Lab 5, Part 1 – Rectangle Area](https://github.com/cpsc-fall-2025/cpsc-120-lab-05-brandon-and-lynn/tree/main/part-1) 
  
  Lab 5, part 1, is one of my favorite labs because it challenged me enough to push me to understand the fuction definitions more clearly. This lab improved my ability to define and use functions correctly. It also deepened my understanding of how header files work in a multi-file program. 

- [Lab 6, Part 1 – Build a Sandwich](https://github.com/cpsc-fall-2025/cpsc-120-lab-06-alexandria-lynn/tree/main/part-1)

  Lab 6, part 1, is my favorite lab because it was fun. I liked the idea of making a sandwich using code. The lab helped me understand the significance of index positions in a vector, especially when dealing with command-line arguments. I learned how to validate input correctly and fix formatting issues, since I ran into a lot of those at first. This lab helped me feel more comfortable writing code. 

- [Lab 10, Part 2 – Density of US States](https://github.com/cpsc-fall-2025/cpsc-120-lab-10-lynn/tree/main/part-2)

  Lab 10, part 2, is one of my favorite labs because it was the most helpful in helping me understand the purpose of vectors. I learned how to use std::stoi correctly and finally understood its purpose when converting data to integers. Overall, this lab was fun to complete and boosted my confidence in handling data stored in files.
